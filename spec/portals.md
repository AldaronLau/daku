# Portals

Portals allow Daku applications to interface with the OS.  The environment is
not required to grant access to all portals requested by the application, and
may either stop the application or mock out a fake implementation to protect the
user's privacy.

Implementations of portals should strive to be "as mathematical" as possible,
meaning that there's no fancy engineering abstractions - just sending and
receiving data and defining the required functionality.  This is to reduce the
risk for possibly needing to deprecating portals in the future.  That said, it's
ok to pack smaller pieces of data into one value if 32-bits can be guaranteed to
most likely never be needed.

Portals should also make use of shared high-level [types](./types.md).
