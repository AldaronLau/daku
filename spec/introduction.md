# Introduction

Daku is an asynchronous system interface API for WebAssembly with a focus on
multimedia.  Some goals may overlap with WASI, others do not.  It is developed
as a supporting specification for the Ardaku project.

# Daku Specification v1.0.0-beta.0 (draft)

The current version of Daku targets the full WebAssembly 2.0 spec without any
non-standard or experimental features.
