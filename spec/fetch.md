# 0x02 - Fetch ðŸ§ª (`ignore-notify`)

Do an HTTP request to specified URL.

### Usage Flow
 - Send `Fetch` type as a command on the fetch portal's channel.
 - "Ready" immediately and overwrites data pointed to by `channel`, but doesn't
   yield to the guest like other `ignore` channels.  Notifies based on readiness
   of new channel with ready data from the original command.
 - Once data is received, buffer is overwritten up to `capacity` bytes, and
   `capacity` set to remaining byte count.
 - Send `FetchConnection` type as command on new `channel` representing HTTP
   connection.
 - Becomes ready when data is ready to be received over HTTP and written into
   the buffer.
