# Daku v1.0.0-pre.0 (draft v13)

> Asynchronous host interface abstraction API for WebAssembly plugins, drivers,
> applications, and more! 

The `daku` crate is designed to be used for applications that run within a host,
such as a plugin in an application, or a driver in an operating system, and even
a program in an operation system (similar to WASI), and more!

## Goals
 
 - Simple
 - Efficient
 - Modular
 - Minimal (in API surface, and memory footprint)
 - Asynchronous
 - Backwards Compatible
 - Reduced context switching
 - Security-first
 - First-class multimedia portals (WASI compatible)
