# Daku v1.0.0-alpha.0
Daku is a system interface API similar to WASI with different goals.

Since it's currently alpha, things may change but changes are somewhat unlikely.
Alpha, beta and pre-release stages will not last very long (once there is an
implementation it will be fully stabilized).

## Goals
 - Async-First
 - Immediately Stable
 - Simple
 - Reduced Syscalls
 - Channel-Based
 - Security via Portals
 - Anti-POSIX
 - Full Multimedia Support

# API
The daku api exports a single function `ar()`:

```wat
(import "daku" "ar" (func $event
    (param $size i32)   ;; List[Command].size
    (param $data i32)   ;; List[Command].reference
    (param $done i32)   ;; List[Ready].reference (capacity=open channel count)
    (result i32)        ;; List[Ready].size (size truncated at 16384)
))
```

The function queues a number of asynchronous tasks, passed as a list (first two
parameters).  When any asynchronous task completes, the function returns the
new size of `$done` and it's contents are overwritten.

## `Command`
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Command {
    /// Channel to send a message on, 0 to open channel
    channel: u32,
    /// The new channel id
    ///  - Nop: Keep same as `channel`
    ///  - Modify: Non-Zero ID â‰  `channel`
    ///  - Discard: Zero (when `channel` is 0, exit)
    new: u32,
    /// Which command to run
    which: u32,
    /// Data to send and/or receive over channel
    data: *mut (), 
}
```

## Types

### Time
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Time {
    /// Range: 0 ~ 23 (always UTC, localized only for display)
    hour: u8,
    /// Range: 0 ~ 59
    minute: u8,
    /// Range: 0 ~ 60_999 (can represent leap seconds)
    millis: u16,
}
```

### Date
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Date {
    /// Range: 0 ~ 65_535
    year: u16,
    /// Range: 1 ~ 12
    month: u8,
    /// Range: (of week: 1 ~ 7) << 5 | (of month: 1 ~ 31)
    day: u8,
}
```

### DateTime
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct DateTime {
    date: Date,
    time: Time,
}
```

### List
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct List<T> {
    size: u32,
    data: *mut T,
}
```

### Text
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Text {
    /// Number of bytes
    size: u32,
    /// UTF-8 String
    data: *mut u8,
}
```

### Overclock
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
enum Overclock {
    Off = 0,
}
```

### TimeZone
```rust
#[repr(C, u32)]
enum TimeDesignation {
    Utc = 0,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct TimeAdjustment {
    /// Time to replace
    when: DateTime,
    /// New time
    new: DateTime,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct LeapSecond {
    /// Which year
    year: i16,
    /// Always the last day of the month
    month: u8,
    /// Direction: Either -1 or +1
    delta: i8,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct TimeZone {
    /// Name of TimeZone (abbreviated, null terminated unless size 6)
    designation: TimeDesignation,
    /// List of adjustments made in this timezone
    deltas: List<TimeAdjustment>,
    /// Replace UTC jan 1 00:00:00:000 year 0 with Local time adjustments
    /// 
    /// This must be equivalent to all of the adjustments in `deltas` plus
    /// any daylight savings time modifications.
    offset: DateTime,
    /// List of leap seconds
    leap_seconds: List<LeapSecond>,
    /// Sum of leap seconds
    leap: i16,
    /// Is daylight savings time?
    is_dst: bool,
    /// Reserved for future use
    reserved: u8,
}
```

### Lang
```rust
#[repr(C, u32)]
enum Language {
    /// English United States
    EnUS = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"enUS"),
    /// English Great Britain
    EnGB = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"enGB"),
    /// Esperanto
    EoXX = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"eoXX"),
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Lang {
    /// List of languages in order of user preference (0 is most preferred)
    list: List<Language>,
}
```

## Commands
Commands can be added in new versions of the Daku spec, and can be deprecated,
but never removed.  Because of strict backwards-compatibility their spec should
aim to be as mathematical as possible rather than engineered.  Command ids are
always allocated starting from 0, then incrementing by 1.

When you open a channel, you will receive data whenever it's ready.  Some data
doesn't change, so you can close the channel after the first receive.

Receiving commands must send a capacity in a `size` field for variable length
items, and if the capacity is not met, the `size` field gets set to the required
length and data set to NULL.

 0. Get CPU Architecture `recv: u32`
    ```rust

    enum Arch {
        Wasm = 0,
        RiscV = 1,
        Arm = 2,

        Unknown = u32::MAX,
    }

 14. Set User:Username `send: Text`
 15. Set User:FullName `send: Text`
 16. Set User:Language `send: Lang`
 17. Spawn child process / task `send: Task`.
     Becomes "ready" when task sends a message, and shared_memory is written
     then sent back on next call to `ar()`.  If another task is sent, replaces
     the child task.  Close the channel to stop the child task.
     ```rust
     #[repr(C, packed)]
     struct Task {
         /// A WebAssembly file
         spawn_wasm_len: u32,
         spawn_wasm_data: *mut u8,
         /// Share memory with child task (mmap-like)
         shared_memory_size: u32,
         shared_memory_data: *mut u8,
     }
     ```
 18. Connect to parent channel `send: Message`
     ```rust
     #[repr(C, packed)]
     struct Message {
         /// Share memory with parent task (mmap-like)
         shared_memory_size: u32,
         shared_memory_data: *mut u8,
     }
     ```
     Once connected, send an empty (null) command to wake parent task and
     transfer message.
 19. Log `send: Log`
     ```rust
     #[repr(C, packed)]
     struct Print {
         /// Log index (which log to print to)
         which: u16,
         /// Which levels to print to (bit flags):
         ///  - 0 DEBUG
         ///  - 1 INFO
         ///  - 2 WARNING
         ///  - 3 ERROR
         /// Which levels are enabled
         ///  - 4 DEBUG
         ///  - 5 INFO
         ///  - 6 WARNING
         ///  - 7 ERROR
         level: u8,
         /// Set name for this log index instead of printing
         set_name: bool,
         /// Text to print (on it's own line)
         text: Text,
     }
     ```

         [Icon; 3],
     }
