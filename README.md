# Daku v1.0.0-pre.0 (draft v11)

> Asynchronous host interface abstraction API for WebAssembly plugins, drivers,
> applications, and more! 

The `daku` crate is designed to be used for applications that run within a host,
such as a plugin in an application, or a driver in an operating system, and even
a program in an operation system (similar to WASI), and more!

Since Daku is currently in the pre-release stage, things may change based on
feedback but large changes are unlikely.

The [daku specification](https://ardaku.org/daku) is currently in draft, so some
remnants of the old spec may remain in this README and other files in the
repository for now.

## Goals
 - Modular
 - Minimal (in API surface, and memory footprint)
 - Asynchronous
 - Stable base API
 - As simple and efficient as possible
 - Reduced context switching
 - Security-first
 - First-class multimedia portals
 - Portals compatible with WASI versions via 2-way abstractions

## Types

### TimeZone
```rust
#[repr(C, u32)]
enum TimeDesignation {
    Utc = 0,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct TimeAdjustment {
    /// Time to replace
    when: DateTime,
    /// New time
    new: DateTime,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct LeapSecond {
    /// Which year
    year: i16,
    /// Always the last day of the month
    month: u8,
    /// Direction: Either -1 or +1
    delta: i8,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct TimeZone {
    /// Name of TimeZone (abbreviated, null terminated unless size 6)
    designation: TimeDesignation,
    /// List of adjustments made in this timezone
    deltas: List<TimeAdjustment>,
    /// Replace UTC jan 1 00:00:00:000 year 0 with Local time adjustments
    /// 
    /// This must be equivalent to all of the adjustments in `deltas` plus
    /// any daylight savings time modifications.
    offset: DateTime,
    /// List of leap seconds
    leap_seconds: List<LeapSecond>,
    /// Sum of leap seconds
    leap: i16,
    /// Is daylight savings time?
    is_dst: bool,
    /// Reserved for future use, set to 0
    reserved: u8,
}
```

### Lang
```rust
#[repr(C, u32)]
enum Language {
    /// English United States
    EnUS = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"enUS"),
    /// English Great Britain
    EnGB = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"enGB"),
    /// Esperanto
    EoXX = u32::from_ne_bytes(*b"eoXX"),
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Lang {
    /// List of languages in order of user preference (0 is most preferred)
    list: List<Language>,
}
```
