# 3. Read developer commands

Read a developer command (stdin).  If capacity is unchanged, then the command
was read successfully.  If it changed, then the buffer is too small and must be
enlarged.

```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Text {
    /// Length of string
    size: usize,
    /// UTF-8 String
    data: *mut u8,
}

#[repr(C, packed)]
struct Dev {
    /// Text (in/out)
    text: *mut Text,
    /// Capacity (in/out)
    capacity: *mut usize,
}
```
