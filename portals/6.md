# 6. Spawn Child Tasks

## Commands
 0. Spawn child process / task `send: Task`.
     Becomes "ready" when task sends a message, and shared_memory is written
     then sent back on next call to `ar()`.  If another task is sent, replaces
     the child task.  Close the channel to stop the child task.
     ```rust
     #[repr(C, packed)]
     struct Task {
         /// A WebAssembly file
         spawn_wasm_len: u32,
         spawn_wasm_data: *mut u8,
         /// Share memory with child task (mmap-like)
         shared_memory_size: u32,
         shared_memory_data: *mut u8,
     }
     ```
 1. Connect to parent channel `send: Message`
     ```rust
     #[repr(C, packed)]
     struct Message {
         /// Share memory with parent task (mmap-like)
         shared_memory_size: u32,
         shared_memory_data: *mut u8,
     }
     ```
     Once connected, send an empty (null) command to wake parent task and
     transfer message.
